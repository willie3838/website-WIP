            <p>Hi! My name is William and
                I am a computer science student at the University of Western Ontario
                with an intent to dual degree with the Ivey School of Business. 
                As a tech enthusiast, I have taken an interest in artificial intelligence
                and I hope to be able to assist others in leveraging this technology
                in the future. <br><br>
                
                During my free time, you can find me swimming, reading YA novels, or
                playing a few games of League of Legends with my friends. (As an aside, 
                gaming has been a large part of my life and I founded an Esports organization
                to help others pursue their passion for gaming). Moreover, as a lifelong learner,
                I find myself learning new skills all the time, whether it be as simple as whistling to
                something as technical as building neural networks.<br><br>

                Additionally, here is a list of technologies that I've been working with over the years:
